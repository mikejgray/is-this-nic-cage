I've been exploring Machine Learning using the FastAI course at https://fast.ai and this was my first attempt at creating my own ML solution. In tests it performed with 92.5% accuracy, which I considered fairly good considering I've never done Machine Learning before.

Please reach out and let me know if this is working for you! I plan to improve upon it as I learn more about Machine Learning.
